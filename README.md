ShopwareCLI
===========

ShopwareCLI is not only a growing library of shopware CLI Tools, but a full blown infrastructure framework for adding
feature rich command line applications to your shopware system.

It is build upon the powerful symfony console component, supports management of mulitple shopware instances and ships
with a growing set of administrative task managers and code generators.

> Disclaimer: ShopwareCLI is a fall-out from my daily work with shopware. I'm not releasing it because it's yet stable
> and it's not associated with the shopware AG. I'm pushing it open source, because I'm not comfortable with closed source.
